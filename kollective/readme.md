### Description
---------------
SD ECDN Self-Service Trial, crafted for the IT Pro, is a live interaction that lets you experience how a portion of Kollective’s video delivery system behaves in a network environment. 
You will set-up three Virtual Machine’s (VM), including Kollective agents. Once set-up, you will start a live video stream on one of the VM’s, designated as a LAN Leader. 
Watch the LAN Leader share the stream with two other VMs. 
Stop and start the video stream and watch the distributed algorithms in action as the Kollective agents elect a new LAN Leader, without compromising quality across all streams.

    - The first VM user to start the stream becomes LAN Leader and becomes primary source of stream.
    - Orange color code is used to denote the LAN Leader.
    - The second and third VM become the recipients of the video stream.
    - Blue/green color code denotes the recipient VMs.
    - If the leader node gets unresponsive or disengage the video stream the SD ECDN has the capability 
      to elect automatically a new Video stream caster/ LAN leader.
